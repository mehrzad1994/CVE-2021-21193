## what is CVE?

CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number. Security advisories issued by vendors and researchers almost always mention at least one CVE ID. CVEs help IT professionals coordinate their efforts to prioritise and address these vulnerabilities to make computer systems more secure.

## Google chrome 
The chrome team have published an announcement on march 2021 that If you use Google Chrome on any of your devices, it is urgent that you update it immediately. There are frequent Google Chrome updates, but the most recent patch, stable build 89.0.4389.90, patches several vulnerabilities, three of which have a high severity rating, and one of which has already been exploited by cybercriminals and hackers.

It was one of the high severity rating vulnerabilities called CVE-2021-21193. It is a vulnerability in Google Chrome’s browser engine Blink, the main component responsible for converting HTML code into the well-designed Web pages you’re used to browsing. This problem impacts certain unidentified processing in the Blink component and the manipulation with an unknown input leads to a memory corruption vulnerability. This vulnerability that has been exploited by malefactors suggests all users need to update to version 89.0.4389.90.

It is a use-after-free vulnerability, which means Blink had trouble clearing memory.

While this seems trivial and mundane, a use-after-free vulnerability’s most common consequences are data corruption and arbitrary code execution, which, according to the National Vulnerability Database’s description of the CVE-2021-21193 vulnerability itself can allow “a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.”
